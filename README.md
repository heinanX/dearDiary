This is a Next.js test project for fetching data within server components. To make it more engaging, I designed a simple diary application with a custom-built calendar that uses the date-fns npm package.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
